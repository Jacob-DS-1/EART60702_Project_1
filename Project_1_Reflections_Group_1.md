My primary responsibilities in Project 1 were to: conduct initial data cleaning and EDA; compile and enhance Python scripts; produce and strengthen visualisations to make findings clear; conduct QA and edits on the final presentation.  

During this project, I have further developed my understanding of the data science process, particularly in the context of earth and environmental sciences. For me, it highlighted the importance of a strong narrative and rationale behind research questions. I feel we implemented this well, with each part of our research question following logically from the previous and being well motivated by our initial EDA.  

Initially, I found it challenging to pitch the appropriate level since the task was open-ended, with group members having different areas of expertise. However, on reflection, this gave us the freedom to explore the data and choose a particular direction that could provide meaningful insights. Additionally, the variety of expertise in the group allowed us to collaborate in ways that may not have been possible had we been working in a more homogeneous team.  

On a subject knowledge level, I also developed my understanding of concepts like urban heat islands and typical approaches in the literature to defining extreme heat and precipitation events. Overall, this project has developed my ability to collaborate in diverse teams, improved my knowledge of environmental science, and influenced how I will approach and structure future data science projects. I am proud of the quality of our research and findings.

My role focused on the background research, and the basic methods and coding foundations of the environmental data analysis. In Project 1 I gained a lot, mainly in using Python to process data, and I was so surprised to learn that Python can do all the things I used to do with certain other applications. This made me realise that Python is indeed a very powerful tool. In the past, I would complete all data analysis using Excel or ArcGIS scripts. Usually, I could complete the required tasks, but the functionality of these tools couldn't match the ability of directly writing Python programs to analyse data. For example, it took me one month to complete the data processing for my undergraduate thesis, although the data itself was more complex than the project. I hope to learn more functions in Project 2.

In Project 1, my main responsibility was to integrate all the parts of our group's work and produce the final presentation. This required me to review all the analysis results, identify key findings, and organise them into a clear and logical structure. Through this process, I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the entire project workflow, from data analysis to interpretation and communication. What's more, I gained practical experience in exploring and analysing environmental data using JupyterLab. Compared with my previous experience mainly using Excel, working in a Python environment enabled me to understand the analysis process more systematically. More importantly, I learned how to interpret changes and patterns in the data and use these patterns to make reasonable judgments about possible future environmental trends. This helped me shift from merely processing data to thinking more critically about the actual significance of the data in an environmental context.  

Preparing for this presentation also enhanced my ability to summarise complex technical information and transform it into clear visual and oral messages. I was responsible for constructing the slides of the presentation, refining the charts and text, and ensuring consistency among different parts, thus making the final outcome well-organised and easy to understand. In addition, collaborating with my two group members was an important part of the learning process. Through regular communication and discussion, I was able to better understand different analytical methods and improve the overall quality of the final work. This experience of teamwork not only enabled me to acquire technical skills but also taught me how to coordinate, integrate and communicate effectively within a team.
